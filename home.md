# Welcome to SciFi Farm's (SFF) Wiki

# Overview
This wiki is the place to store anything related to SciFi Farms (SFF) or TechnoCore. It's very much a work in progress and colaboration(THIS SHOULD BE A LINK) is encoraged. Below are the main components you'll likely be interested in. 

## Major Components
- **[Working with TechnoCore](/technocore/working-with-technocore)**
TechnoCore is a framework for deploying various Docker services into a Swarm cluster. It's the platform that SFF built and uses to manage our software services and SeedShips.
- **[Working with SeedShips](/seedships/working-with-seedships)**
Fundamentially, SeedShips are CEA (Controlled Environment Agrculture) environments that rely heavily on open source and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies that have been modified and preconfigured to work together and scale with ease. 
- **[Developing TechnoCore](/technocore/development)**
How to get a functional development enviornment as well as the assumptions that must be satisfied in order for things to happen automagically. 
- **[Contributing](/technocore/contributing)** 
For a long time, I was unable to support contributors because the architeture and services were changing so frequently, but that has changed and this documentation is written with the hope that others will read it and have something to add. 
- **[SciFi Farm](/sff)**
Information and notes on the business side of SciFi Farms.
- **[Controlled Environment Agriculture](/cea)**
Notes and resources for what you might need to run your own controlled enviornment.
